This repository provides a complete tool for training models. 
The main ideas when developing this repository: 
- simplicity of architecture 
- ability to use many approaches, in particular written in open-source frameworks such as [huggingface](https://github.com/huggingface)
- code style: **lower_case** for all except **ClassNames**
